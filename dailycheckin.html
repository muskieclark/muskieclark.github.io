        <p>Monday, Feb 21 - today was cool. woke up at like 6:20 and had school, which was boring as usual. learned about the pythagoreas theorum or smth.
            had bass lessons after school. we did some work on my knowledge of theory because i am a pretty ok bassist but you can never know too much
            theory. also had an orchestra concert (piano) and jazzband concert (bass). I think I did pretty good. had fun too.
            i was tired af after tho. it's 10:20 and im going to bed so see y'all</p><br>

      <p>Monday, Feb 20 - today i woke up at like 6 and stayed in bed for about 3 hours because I am a lazy ass little fella during days off of school.
        I got ready and didn't do my hair because screw that. I went to the basement, where my makeshift music studio is. I hopelessly fiddled on the piano
        trying to find something that sounded good. Nothing did. I ate some honeycombs for lunch (btw I don't eat breakfast because I never have time because
        on school days I have to wake up at 5:45 if I want to get there on time and I am not a very wakeable person so sometimes I accidentally sleep in 
        until like 6:30). Then I was forced to do homework and I am currently procrastinating writing an essay. Also tried coffee earlier (I'm a tea guy) 
          because apparently coffee is supposed to increase the focus and attention span of people with ADHD, like me, and it worked, but
          i got 2 awful headaches (i never get headaches) and now I don't like coffee. but yea. pretty chill day.</p>
