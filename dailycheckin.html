      <p>Monday, Feb 20 - Today I woke up at like 6 and stayed in bed for about 3 hours because I am a lazy ass little fella during days off of school.
        I got ready and didn't do my hair because screw that. I went to the basement, where my makeshift music studio is. I hopelessly fiddled on the piano
        trying to find something that sounded good. Nothing did. I ate some honeycombs for lunch (btw I don't eat breakfast because I never have time because
        on school days I have to wake up at 5:45 if I want to get there on time and I am not a very wakeable person so sometimes I accidentally sleep in 
        until like 6:30). Then I was forced to do homework and I am currently procrastinating writing an essay. Pretty chill day.</p>
