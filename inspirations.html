  <p>Mar 17, 2023 - i recently asked bill wurtz about how he utilizes percussion so effectively. i realized while reading i
  had a good chance to rephrase my question a lot better, but he answered my question with this:</p>
  <img src="billwurtzquestion1.png" alt="queston">
  <p>this is a very interesting strategy, and this is usually how i go about my songwriting as well, where i
  write and record all other parts of the songs before i write and record the drum, but i think the difference
  is i have less control because i record on only actual, physical drums, and in only 1 take. i think something i
  could do would to be record some of my drum parts physically, so it sounds realistic ish, and record each thingy seperately.
  then, add in some detail using a drums plugin.</p>
  <p>Mar 5, 2023 - bob dylan's "hurricane." i like how it tells a story (like most of bob dylan's songs) whereas a lot of songs are just
  about something and not really telling a story. i also love the harmonica section at the end and want to do something similar with the unnamed song.</p>
      <p>Feb 24, 2023 - i really like halfalive's ok ok, i like what they did with the panning and the vocal percussion going from<br>
      ear to ear. maybe i could incorporate something like this into moon song since it's supposed to be a less percussive track<br>
        (instad of using drums i would take inspiration from this method).</p>
