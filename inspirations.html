      <h1>inspirations</h1>
      <p>Feb 24, 2023 - i really like halfalive's ok ok, i like what they did with the panning and the vocal percussion going from<br>
      ear to ear. maybe i could incorporate something like this into moon song since it's supposed to be a less percussive track<br>
      (instad of using drums i would take inspiration from this method).</p>
