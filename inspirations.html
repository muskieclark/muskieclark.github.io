      <h1>inspirations</h1>
  <p>Mar 5, 2023 - bob dylan's "hurricane." i like how it tells a story (like most of bob dylan's songs) whereas a lot of songs are just
  about something and not really telling a story. i also love the harmonica section at the end and want to do something similar with the unnamed song.</p>
      <p>Feb 24, 2023 - i really like halfalive's ok ok, i like what they did with the panning and the vocal percussion going from<br>
      ear to ear. maybe i could incorporate something like this into moon song since it's supposed to be a less percussive track<br>
      (instad of using drums i would take inspiration from this method).</p>
