2:02 pm</dco> &nbsp;<qco> hi bill, so this might be a weird question, but you're one of the few people I know of who keep things real and down to earth. so recently I noticed that I was actively avoiding listening to a few songs that I'd vibed hard with. odd thing is they're all from this one timeframe, october 2021. that's very strange, since they're really good songs in my opinion. does this happen to you as well? </qco></h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i think so<h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like they're just uncomfortable to listen to. I know you try not to listen to your old songs. does that share anything in common with this phenomenon? </qco></h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;maybe a little bit, but i think that would be even more sensitive because i'm actually responsible for creating the songs<h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because so far I kinda have a theory as to why it's happening for me. that was around the time I made some very bad choices, and they rewarded me at that time. as a result, I continued with it, a habit I have only recently been able to foresee the consequences of and have begun undoing (no it's not robbery or anything like that. more like self-deception). maybe I just don't want to be reminded of the time where everything took a turn for the awful?</qco></h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yes, i think that makes sense<h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I understand if you don't want to respond to this since it's basically me venting using your page to do so. but I'm feeling better already :)</qco> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</br></br><h3> <dco>2.17.23&nbsp; 
12:18 pm</dco> &nbsp;<qco> What's your favorite 7-letter word?</qco> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</br></br><h3> <dco>2.17.23&nbsp; 
8:59 am</dco> &nbsp;<qco> what's the wackiest time signature you've ever written in</qco> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
it sounds like you're looking for something where the time signature stays the same, even though that's definitely not the wackiest you can do with time signatures, nor is it the wackiest i've done with them. However, if we're only including non-changing time signatures then the answer would probably be the 'violence' outtro of ball and stick which should be 13/16 if i remember correctly

</br></br><h3> <dco>2.17.23&nbsp; 
1:22 am</dco> &nbsp;<qco> When you go back to unfinished songs from several years ago to work on them, do you ever come across any that make you go "Wow I don't relate to that anymore" or "Wow I wouldn't write a song like that today"? If you do, do you still decide to work on them/does that make it any harder to work on them than if it was a song you still related to? If you don't, disregard that last question</qco> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
sometimes they can be transformed into something that works for me in the present day

</br></br><h3> <dco>2.17.23&nbsp;

on "gameplay" it's like F#min11 (maybe something like Eadd4/F# is a better way to explain it). on "fade" it goes to like F#sus2sus4 but then it switches on "away" to more like F#maj9
</br></br><h3> <dco>2.16.23&nbsp;

it's time to remember what exactly the big project is. what it was when you started it, how it felt, why you wanted it, etc. What if you had to explain these things to someone, such as a duck, right now?
</br></br><h3> <dco>2.15.23&nbsp; 
3:32 pm</dco> &nbsp;<qco> What is your opinion on the philosophy of Absurdism expounded by the 20th century French philosopher Albert Camus?</qco> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
just a wild guess but i'm assuming that absurdism doesn't have to be as academic as you made it sound
</br></br><h3> <dco>2.15.23&nbsp;

my mind is running wild about whether that means it's 1, 3, or some other entirely different number
</br></br><h3> <dco>2.15.23&nbsp; 
11:26 am</dco> &nbsp;<qco> i feel like people overcomplicate things a lot. why do you think this happens</qco> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
i assume it's to balance out all the times they undercomplicate things
</br></br><h3> <dco>2.15.23&nbsp; 
11:10 am</dco> &nbsp;<qco> Are you going on a podcast to talk about your memories?</qco> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</br></br><h3> <dco>2.15.23&nbsp;

8:04 am</dco> &nbsp;<qco> why do people say "OK" when i'm not asking her a yes no questio</qco> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
maybe you were asking "how are you doing", or, "how was the ____ (something)?". Or, maybe you just proclaimed something, like, ........ 'i am a &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bunny &nbsp;rabbit.'
</br></br><h3> <dco>2.15.23&nbsp; 
6:17 am</dco> &nbsp;<qco> are you a funky fellow with smooth tunes?</qco> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
not exactly
</br></br><h3> <dco>2.15.23&nbsp; 
1:31 am</dco> &nbsp;<qco> do you ever write lyrics by making a word string composed of words that "go with" or "sound like" each note of the melody rather than writing a phrase that "equals" the melody as a whole?</qco> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
all 3 of your quoted phrases seem to blend into each other. in the context of what you just said, i can't really tell the difference between the meaning of those 3 phrases

</br></br><h3> <dco>2.14.23&nbsp; 
8:21 pm</dco> &nbsp;<qco> how do you feel after making a music or a song or idk?</qco> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
good
</br></br><h3> <dco>2.14.23&nbsp; 
8:20 pm</dco> &nbsp;<qco> would you consider writing a song or a part of a song in 11/8?</qco> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
that's interesting, i was just going to ask you if you'd ever consider writing a sentence with 44 letters
</br></br><h3> <dco>2.14.23&nbsp; 
7:08 pm</dco> &nbsp;<qco> what does it feel like to work</qco> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
it either feels so wrong or so right. depending on whether you're on the right track

</br></br><h3> <dco>2.14.23&nbsp; 
2:59 pm</dco> &nbsp;<qco> when you make music videos in blender, do you have any techniques for syncing up audio and video? im thinking of making a 3d animated music video but blender doesnt support adding audio to the project itslef</qco> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
yes it does
</br></br><h3> <dco>2.14.23&nbsp; 
2:41 pm</dco> &nbsp;<qco> what year is it</qco> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
must be in the billions by now
</br></br><h3> <dco>2.14.23&nbsp; 
2:32 pm</dco> &nbsp;<qco> What is something that reminds you of the future</qco> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</br></br><h3> <dco>2.14.23&nbsp; 
2:08 pm</dco> &nbsp;<qco> does streaming your songs on spotify all day long help you in any way (financially speaking)?</qco> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
yes i believe it does
</br></br><h3> <dco>2.14.23&nbsp; 
12:29 pm</dco> &nbsp;<qco> chocolate fudge or strawberry poptart?</qco> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
i think you forgot to attach the item. i'm seeing neither
</br></br><h3> <dco>2.14.23&nbsp; 
12:19 pm</dco> &nbsp;<qco> How prepared are you to do fills in the recording process? Is it trial and error? Or do you hear everything before going in?</qco> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
some of the really important ones are written into the song before the recording process begins. other ones are not. i've made a list of some examples before. ah, <a href="q.php?date=202209270322"target="_blank">here it is</a>

</br></br><h3> <dco>2.14.23&nbsp; 
9:31 am</dco> &nbsp;<qco> <a href="q.php?date=202302131106">2.13.23&nbsp;&nbsp;11:06 am</a>  are you saying everyone will be each other at some point</qco> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
a lot of the great conundrums of consciousness seem to suddenly make sense when you consider that angle, i've found. although first, infinite time must be considered. which also solves a lot of conundrums (conundra?). although admittedly it's kind of a mindfuck. which, admittedly, might be needed in order for such conundrums to be solved
</br></br><h3> <dco>2.14.23&nbsp; 
2:34 am</dco> &nbsp;<qco> if i do a phonetic cover of one of your jingles (same melody, different words), would you like to be credited in the description of where it appears?&nbsp;</qco> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
if that happens, legally i am supposed to be credited financially (with money / royalty payments, etc). i'm not sure if it's possible to put that in the description

</br></br><h3> <dco>2.14.23&nbsp; 
12:44 am</dco> &nbsp;<qco> Do you think Vienna exists, </qco></h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yes<h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and is it waiting for you?</qco> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i'm not sure

</br></br><h3> <dco>2.13.23&nbsp; 
11:50 pm</dco> &nbsp;<qco> in "two friends on a beach" I can relate so much to the two characters because even though they're speaking complete nonsense, I can relate to having a chill conversation with a friend. is this what you were going for, nonsensical but still relatable?</qco> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
absolutely not, and you've also proven that that's not what it is. if you relate to it, then it couldn't be nonsense. if you relate to it then you have found the sense in it. in fact, just thinking through it, .... i don't recall a single part of it that doesn't make sense


</br></br><h3> <dco>2.13.23&nbsp; 
11:19 pm</dco> &nbsp;<qco> Will we ever see you in an interview again?</qco> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
yep. i have 2 this week, one of which you will see me and the other one you will just hear me but i hope that counts
</br></br><h3> <dco>2.13.23&nbsp; 
11:17 pm</dco> &nbsp;<qco> How do I stop worrying?</qco> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
just fix everything
</br></br><h3> <dco>2.13.23&nbsp; 
10:51 pm</dco> &nbsp;<qco> i'm going to the beach soon what are some things to do there</qco> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
venture out to sea
</br></br><h3> <dco>2.13.23&nbsp; 
10:17 pm</dco> &nbsp;<qco> do you use a big library of your own models or someone else's or do you make them on the fly?</qco> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
i have a library of my own models. it's not necessarily big enough but it's growing. and i make new ones as needed, and hopefully remember to add them to the library. and then sometimes if i forget to add the new stuff then sometimes i climb back through the most recent projects and try to add the new stuff to the library
</br></br><h3> <dco>2.13.23&nbsp; 
10:04 pm</dco> &nbsp;<qco> you think you'll ever spend more than a year on working on nothing else but a crazy new project?&nbsp;</qco> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
i suppose you could say that between may 2019 and august 2020 i was working on assimilating some new technologies into my workflow. which could be considered 1 project because i seemed to refuse to make any progress on any actual song or video during that time

</br></br><h3> <dco>2.13.23&nbsp; 
9:43 pm</dco> &nbsp;<qco> you said in an old reality vid that 'crazy/raining' felt like a drag in the list, did it still feel that way during the recording/rewrite process or did your opinion change? it's one of my favorite songs, it just hits right in th feels
<br/></qco> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
every song in the list has its own way of being wrong. too smart, too dumb, too weird, too normal, too fast, too slow....... you can see that most of these complaints come in pairs of opposites. which i suppose is proof that everything's fine
</br></br><h3> <dco>2.13.23&nbsp; 
8:44 pm</dco> &nbsp;<qco> what's the best syllable?</qco> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&#601;

</br></br><h3> <dco>2.13.23&nbsp; 
4:16 pm</dco> &nbsp;<qco> Is there life outside of this desolate planet we inhabit?</qco> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
first let's talk about the way you just called it desolate: by comparison to every other planet anywhere near here, this planet is by far the least desolate planet. i'd say this is the only non-desolate planet that anyone around here has ever even heard of. To answer your first question, yes i think there's probably life somewhere else in addition to here but i think it's probably pretty far away 
</br></br><h3> <dco>2.13.23&nbsp; 
1:28 pm</dco> &nbsp;<qco> do you have any focus techniques for writing songs in a noisy environment like classroom&nbsp;</qco> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

1:13 pm</dco> &nbsp;<qco> are you the cringe soy sad small pepo wojack jojack or the based redpilled gamer chad gigachad</qco> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
i've been whatever i am since long before those terminology existed. i believe the slang term for it is person

</br></br><h3> <dco>2.13.23&nbsp;

all in due time

</br></br><h3> <dco>2.13.23&nbsp; 
10:51 am</dco> &nbsp;<qco> Sometimes it feels like everything we say and do and think is reverberating backwards and forwards through time, and if you're very still for a moment you might catch a glimpse of what someone else is feeling or has felt or will feel, without them ever saying anything, you know what i mean?</qco> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
yes

i'd say it alternates over time, at a rate of one switch per the smallest possible time-unit. which is currently thought to be something called the Planck time.

9:04 pm</dco> &nbsp;<qco> What inspired you to make "meet me in september"</qco> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
i was on a schedule where a song (with video) had to be done, so that is the reason that *a* song/video (didn't have to be that one) got done at that time, and the reason that particular one got picked was because it was the only one i wanted to do at that time. i recall going through the entire list and not finding anything i wanted, but i'd accidentally skipped that one, so that one literally turned up in the last place i could have looked. That being said, it had no title or lyric when i selected it. So the reason it became 'meet me in septemter' is because that is the best line i could come up with for the first/title line. Going back to before it was selected, the reason i came up with that idea in the first place is because that's part of my job as a songwriter/producer. gotta come up with the ideas. that's pretty much the first step. I'm sure i came up with at least a dozen different other ideas on the same day. i tend to do them in batches unless a freebie drops on my head in a dream or something

actually i think the problem here is you are thinking too much. you didn't even indicate that you are sure about the trend here. i can almost guarantee the trend you think you are seeing is at best negligible to none, and at worst, self-correcting if you don't worry about it. perhaps like a rainy day. but i maintain that it's likely you are not even seeing a real trend. what this looks like to me is just a worried mood and a bit of over thinking. As soon as you find some more concrete direction and tasks to deal with, i think this current worry will float away

i guess you must be similar to me in some way. i mean, it's good in this case because you relate to it, but i couldn't exactly do that on purpose. What i can do, is make videos that i myself relate to. and i happen to know that this will always result in other people relating to it too. you never know which people it will be, but you know they'll be out there. so, in this case, it sounds like you might be one of those people, at least in the case of whichever videos you have seen so far. however i should clarify that almost nothing i've ever made feels like dread, except for just a general shortfall in the production department, which i tend to perceive differently depending on my mood

That reminds me of how it's currently February, 2023, and we can't seem to get to any month beyond that<h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;how do you get out of it ( i tried imagining what would happen after that part but all i can imagine is a loop )
</qco></h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all the information is relevant. For example: you say you tend to hear it as a loop. Ok, so, ..... is that good or bad? Is there any reason why you feel it should not be a loop? Do you not like the way it feels as a loop? Many great songs indeed are viable as a loop. So i'd say, be open to the possibility of a loop (unless you hate it.) Actually i should be more specific.... when you say loop, are you saying absolutely everything repeats? or are you saying like just the chords and certain things loop? Many songs have a loop but they still use different melodies for cho and verse, or something. On the other hand, there's probably other songs that actually just about use the same melody for both...... anyway, my point is, all the information you can gather from your impressions after the run through is valid, and should be considered. So in this case, your impression is that it seems to loop. Consider the possibility of making it loop. If not the whole thing exactly, then consider the possibility of keeping the same form / chords and then just raising or lowering the energy. in most loop based songs, the raise and lower of energy is the bread and butter that takes you from verse to chorus to verse<h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;does it get easier to come up with more stuff over time, as you finish more songs</qco> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
you might get some more wisdom over time, but i feel like nothing is ever going to fully shield you from this dread zone of 'trying too hard' and 'thinking too much.' And i'm not blaming you. The reason you are thinking and trying is because you really care about this damn thing, and rightfully so. But the weird thing about music is it really clams up when people start trying and thinking a lot. It wants to find you, so be aware that it will find you. you just don't always get to decide when. But until then, just recognize all the information you are getting, which, in this case, is that it seems to require a loop. That's actually a very powerful piece of information. it rules out a lot of things

<a href="q.php?date=202203101129"target="_blank">here</a> was my best assessment of what it is, soon after it came out. what you have is mostly probably gonna work fine, and considering you're trying to do it on guitar, i'm surprised you're able to make all that work. I'm not sure if your last chord is supposed to represent "into the" or "future". if it's "future" then i'd say definitely prioritize the Eb in the bass. but on guitar i know that's asking a lot. after all there are no low Eb notes on guitar, are there

what works for me is to separate this into separate job positions. when i'm idea generating, i'm never in the same job position as someone who's actually gonna work on the song. it allows the idea generation to be carefree and optimistic. so when i'm thinking of ideas, i add things to the list that i think 'could' work. And the truth is, any idea can be made great if it's handled well. so i have the confidence to know that. so i add things to the list, generously. Then, at a different time, in a different job position, i have methods of selection where i 'select' which item in the list is going to be chosen to get finished, and produced. Or there's also another step/job in between that which is to just select things and just develop them a tiny little bit. So this means your initial idea is free to be almost nothing. Just a title.... just a couple of notes.... just a groove... maybe just an image, ... something that is almost nothing, but it's just enough for the next department to grab onto and turn it into something slightly more, for next time

2:06 am</dco> &nbsp;<qco> I've created a song that was supposed to mean one thing, and it's really great when heard in that way with that perspective. However there's another obvious way to see / feel it that causes it to give off really bad vibes. After catching those vibes when listening to a mixdown afterwards, it almost felt like I accidentally released demons during recording. But then I remembered the original intent. Basically the lyrics are kind of a joke and on their own are harmless, but there's still a well-intended normal base meaning I had while creating the song. I arranged and recorded everything fully seriously given that base meaning. Every word I sang was me singing about that base meaning and meaning it, and every piece of instrumentation was realizing the base meaning. However the joke lyrics taken at face value with the intentional arrangement and recordings create a weird vibe. I'm still going to release it, but it's an odd situation.

every time i try to think of a piece of useless knowledge, it suddenly becomes useful as soon as i think of it, because it is now being specifically used to meet the criteria of uselessness. which, in that case, it no longer does. which then means it does. then doesn't. and it creates an unstable infinite loop that could crash the system

it was envisioned with no relation to the grid. it's in its own world. all the notes evenly spaced, and all the chords evenly spaced. and the final landing point is on the swung 'a' of 4 just before the first bar. no happy coincidences occured either, as for where the beginning actually lines up on the grid

3:22 pm</dco> &nbsp;<qco> You said "when it comes, it's a gift" and "it waits until you least expect it" about music (and humor).
<br/>
<br/>I often have this feeling, and I even have good ways to catch the "seed of the gift" by writing it down or by recording myself singing/playing, accurately enough to be able to reconstruct it.
<br/>
<br/>However, I can reconstruct the music but not the feeling/vibe/enthusiasm and it seems dull afterwards and I give up. It seems that a good solution is to continue no matter what (not expecting to be fed by the "good feeling" while working on it),</qco></h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sometimes yes<h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but then i'm afraid that if I work in a "bored" state then I will make "boring" music.
<br/>
<br/>Do you have any thoughts, opinions or whatever about this?</qco> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
i think it's a fair idea. as i was saying, music loves to strike unexpectedly. and it seems you're already analyzing whether you should or should not continue if you are not 'feeling it'. So therefore, it becomes a good idea to continue anyway, because, again, that increases the likelihood that you will forget how hard you're trying

try making it way way way way way way different. you can temporarily suspend the requirement that it's supposed to be good, if that helps you venture further outside the box. the music has such a strong desire to get good anyway that it will surprise you. so, the further you can launch yourself outside, the more rewarding the journey will be

those are 2 different ways of doing it, and i think they are both tied for second best. the real fun starts when you think of the lyrics and music at the exact same time. they mean everything to each other. so if you keep them separate, it will be like more of a long-distance relationship

In general, do you think it's more beneficial to spend significant time to make an ideal plan to follow, or to iterate through several lackluster plans very quickly? I really want to know what you think</qco> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
if you spend a lot of time trying to make the perfect plan it might not connect well to actual reality. the more experience you get, the better you will be at making plans. so it depends how much experience you have in what you're doing. if you don't have much experience, then make smaller plans. But the option you mentioned for smaller plans also called them 'lackluster' which i don't think is really fair. Why did you not allow yourself the option of making small plans that are also good

(and you can still use F# on the staff in the melody if it goes there). Or, if you insist on preserving the "#4" aspect in the chord symbol, you can say Cmaj(add#4,no5). Although i guarantee if you use the second choice on a chart and give it to a player, you are much much more likely to get a pause and confused looks on the first runthrough. where as if you use Cmaj(b5) it increases the chances significantly that they will actually play what you wanted, the first time through. Sure, it's nice to adhere to proper scale numbering / good enharmonics when you can, but sooner or later you run into edge cases where you have to submit to F#=Gb. There are many more extreme cases, but this is an important one that seems to hit home for you

when it comes, it's a gift. like music, it doesn't like not feeling like a gift. so if you push too hard for it, it loses its 'giftyness' and refuses to show. it waits until you least expect it, and then it shows up, as a gift. So the easy part is getting this gift. the hard part is trying so hard for it, and scaring it away for a while

10:33 pm</dco> &nbsp;<qco> if i wanted to improve my improvisation and/or songwriting, would it be useful to learn a new chord every day and see how it feels when played after/before/between/instead of other chords?</qco> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
no. i think doing this will trick you into becoming very uninspired, because a chord includes everything about how/when/where it was used, in the actual song or piece of music. And there's infinite hows/whens/wheres. and each of those things makes everything different about what the chord does. so what i'm saying is, you'll never be able to get a list of all those. So if you say you're gonna "learn a chord" every day, that implies that you're going to be getting them from some list, but there is no list. because it's infinite and there's no order. and some of them are the same, but all of them are the same and different from each other at the same time. Anyway, my point is, the only way to get chords is to either find them how they've already been used in music you know in love, or make them up entirely. so if you're doing it that way, then i think it could be cool. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, for your situation i think i'd recommend 2 different things: 1 is songs/music. just study all the songs/music you actually know and love, and see what they're doing with chords. i think right now you might be expecting it to look like a shelf full of a cereal boxes, lined up like soldiers. but it's really not like that at all, and it's much more like a room full of furniture. that's the best way i can describe it. so if you're learning 1 "piece" of furniture per day, it's gonna be hard enough just to figure out what counts as 1 piece and what counts as 5. or what counts as just the space between the other furniture. anyway, i think you'll see what i mean once you dive into all your favorite songs.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and there's another thing i would suggest, that's totally the opposite of studying songs.  Just spend some separate time just going nuts on the instrument with a total blank canvas and no song or anything, total free time, next to an open window, and just let the demons fly right in. this is where you make up your own way of doing things. your own way of spending time, on the instrument. Just act like you're sitting in a giant barrel of untapped TIME. time to play any note, not play any note, or combination, for as long or not long as you can imagine. sometimes when doing this, using the pitch bend a little bit can be insanely helpful. just playing notes and tweaking the bend up and down by very small amounts while you play, can be an amazing way to cheat your way into that magic zone of actually feeling like you've just played exactly what you meant to play. and then that supercharges you into very quickly and genuinely discovering all kinds of relationships/intervals/shapes. maybe because it unearths the pitches just enough from their *absolute* location and then suddenly the relationships come alive and become way more potent. It's kind of like when you're eating a cake and you're not sure whether you're tasting the cake or just tasting the cake's location. then you move the cake 3 inches to the left and try the cake again, suddenly you have a more keen awareness of what the cake tastes like, regardless of its location

lyrics actually have no sound. if you've performed or sung them out loud, then it's worth looking at the rhythmic/musical quality of how you are saying/singing those lyrics, just as much as what actual words you're using. when one changes, the other changes. they both work together. but if you want to go somewhere different i'd recommend starting from a place that you thought you're never supposed to be. like, i dunno, a mine shaft or something. see if you can songwrite yourself out of a mineshaft. or maybe a Lenscrafters

7:18 am</dco> &nbsp;<qco> here's what i don't get about the theory that "the universe is a simulation"... if our universe is a simulation, that means that there must be a universe that runs this simulation. If there isn't one, and this "simulation" just exists on its own somehow, that would mean the distinction between "real" and "simulation" would be completely arbitrary. so there's another universe that runs this one. but if that's the case, that universe would be the "real" one, and you still run into the same issues that the simulation theory is trying to solve, because how did that universe come into being? is it ALSO a simulation? what about the universe controlling that simulation? you can't just keep going on infinitely, eventually you have to come across the "original" universe. but anyway... what are your thoughts on this</qco> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
i wonder what it would be a simulation of. if it's just a simulation of itself, then, that, i would argue, is the real thing. like if someone met you and said "hey you look just like you. you remind me of you" you'd say "that's right idiot, i AM me"

it's not there, but you're gonna make me open it up and prove it. the flute has absolutely zero notes or sound after the end of bar 15 (where the riff is). but here are some audio clips to investigate whatever you actually are hearing, on the & of 4 ('world') in bar 16. (and for those of you counting along at home, the song starts on bar 2, with the pickup "i'm" being at the end of bar 1). <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so here is 6 beats starting from the top of the bar "dreaming of a brand new world", as is in the final mix: <a href="frontdoorbar16.mp3"target="_blank">frontdoorbar16</a>. And here is the same exact time range with the vocal muted: <a href="frontdoorbar16novoc.mp3"target="_blank">frontdoorbar16novoc</a>. (i can already tell it's gonna be the rhodes). And here is the exact same time range with the drums and bass also muted: <a href="frontdoorbar16nodrbass.mp3"target="_blank">frontdoorbar16nodrbass</a>. Here is just the "world" moment, with voc, drums, and bass muted: <a href="frontdoorworldnodrbass.mp3"target="_blank">frontdoorworldnodrbass</a>. it's getting more and more obvious, i think, that the only culprit here for what you've been hearing is the rhodes chord because it's the only thing playing that note at that time. but i'll give you each of the 3 instruments here individually anyway. Here is the <a href="frontdoorworldbell.mp3"target="_blank">bell</a>, here is the <a href="frontdoorworldpluck.mp3"target="_blank">pluck</a>, (which, as can be heard in the other clips, is playing an E note at the moment in question. the 'D' note played in the pluck doesn't occur until the second 16th note of bar 17) And finally, here is the <a href="frontdoorworldrhodes.mp3"target="_blank">rhodes</a>, which is playing an Asus4 chord, which of course includes the D note, which, while having absolutely nothing to do with the flute riff in the previous bar, is the only plausible explanation for what sound you're hearing here. And, just for the heck of it, here is the <a href="frontdoorworldvoconly.mp3"target="_blank">vocal</a> for the word 'world', just in case there might be some resonance in there that's doing it

yes, this makes sense. most people don't want to do what they don't want to do. one of the best ways to handle this is to better understand why you have to do it. who wants you to do it? why do they want you to do it? have you ever wanted someone else to do something? why did you want them to do it? the more you can close this gap, the more you can love and appreciate the task. And the other thing you can do is start thinking in more detail HOW you are going to do it. imagine you were going to teach someone else how to do it. confusion is very paralyzing, and developing a teachable understanding of any task can often be a great way in

i don't change the questions. that's a company policy i have. in the rare case that i do, i'd make it extremely clear in the answer, and why. the only example i can think of right now is when someone told me, in very specific musical detail, a musical idea that they had in a dream. i wanted to answer the question because i wanted to encourage them to use the idea because it is theirs, and i also wanted to block out the actual details of the idea because i didn't want anyone else to steal it from them. i made it very clear, in my answer, that i had done that

you'll have to never try. this is the easiest, most genuine, and healthiest way to write. it's where you get the absolute best results. the big problem with this method, however, is there is no guarantee that you will ever get any results at all. so for that reason it's not quite professionally viable. if you do 'try', there's many great ways to try, and make inroads to results, but you're gonna get demons

3:37 pm</dco> &nbsp;<qco> so... when i make music, i don't really know what i'm doing. i just stack notes in a certain way in a certain order until it sounds the way i want it to. i'm not sure if this is a very efficient strategy. should i try to actually think ahead about what the chords and rhythms are before putting them down? if so (or maybe even if not), how do i get better at analyzing that sort of stuff?</qco> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
if you like the results you are getting, then surely you're fine. if you're getting restless and want to try something different, then i'm sure there are different ways. i'm not totally sure i understand exactly what way you're doing it, but, ....... at its best, music is usually a magical force that wants to come flying at you in real time. which is always a challenge because to really catch it properly it requires that you can somehow capture it as quickly as it comes. this is a frustrating but magically exciting phenomenon that most writers (music or non) surely must befriend, throughout their life

2:58 am</dco> &nbsp;<qco> I accidentally came up with a super cool melody with awesome chords... but no lyrics. What do you recommend I do here? I worry that anything I come up with will feel forced</qco> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
it's there. if the melody and chords really are super cool, then there is a lyricized version that does work. there are a few tricks to help hone in on it. gather the tiny details that you think you know, or almost know. For example: maybe you know a certain word works really well for part of it, for example let's say the word 'banana' just sounds perfect for the last part of it. Or, maybe you know banana sounds great for that part but you doubt it should be about bananas. Add that factoid to your list of factoids, regardless. write down that you love the word banana at the end but you're not sure if it could work. See if you can hone in on any other things you know, about other tiny parts of it. What can you rule out? what can you rule in? Here's another exercise: just start coming up with as many phoenecically functional things as possible that fit, without regard for what you want it to mean. This will help you notice things: for example you might notice that 80% of the results are phrased as a question. You may notice that these 2 little notes there are always either "in the" or "and it". You may notice that certain phrases keep fitting a certain part, over and over. Now, on the other side of the coin, here's a totally different exercise to try: paraphrase the whole feeling of it, without the melody. so just write down, in as many words as you like, what you think the melody is saying, without worrying about how many words or syllables you use. anything you can grasp onto. maybe you think it has a feeling of freshness. maybe you think it has a feeling of 'morning'. maybe you think it has a feeling of sorrow. maybe you think it has a feeling of good news. write down as much as you can about what you think the melody feels like. Then, maybe certain key words will pop out at you that possibly DO fit. And most importantly, regardless of whether any of this works, going through all this makes it much more likely that the answer will actually just fall on your head later when you're not even thinking about it

Has this happened to you? </qco></h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yes<h3><qco> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'd love a bulletproof way to always wake up immediately after hearing a song, but not so soon that it doesn't have time to finish (which has also happened to me), but I'm not sure if that's possible</qco> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they're hard to catch. the more time you spend writing and coming up with things while you're awake, the easier it will be to remember and understand what you hear in your dreams. and it will also generally increase the chances that the good stuff will also come around while you're awake

try this: write the song somewhere else. then you will be nimble enough to imagine how the song goes, overall, without being plagued with all the exact details of how to build it. you will be free, to imagine it going any way you want. focus on what *happens*. how it will be perceived. see what you're capable of imagining, and see if you can find a writing system that allows you to explain that on the page. Then once you know how the song goes, then hit the studio and then you'll be on a mission

there's massive amounts of scripts in play during the whole animation process, as well as the music production process.

a good thing to latch onto, from the start, is knowing that there is an aspect to your current performance ability that is already awesome. full awesome is always available some how some way, even to someone who doesn't even know how the instrument works. As soon as someone figures out that the note goes on when you press it, and goes off when you unpress it ..... that's already a powerful binary canvas on which to paint, and make wonderful shapes. especially considering that you have all the time in the world to make different on-off designs

i don't know anything about them physically, aside from what you just told me. But i know all about what they sound like, and i use the sound for similar situations as things like xylophone or marimba. the kalimba sounds similar but usually there is a bit of a 'fuzz' or rattle sound to it. it probably shows up in just about every arrangement i put out, because there are always several of them in my repository and i tend to like the sound and find it useful. then again, i think there are also some other instruments i have which sound similar but are named differently. my arrangement process usually does not involve looking up instruments by name

usually not like that, although a lot of people do it that way and i suppose it goes ok.

different industries use it in different amounts. unless you are getting into a classical orchestra you probably won't need to know every little detail about everything, but in general it would probably be cool for you to learn how bars and barlines work, how rhythms work, and also learn about chord symbols. just so you can talk about things with your friends and co-workers a little more clearly

7:09 pm</dco> &nbsp;<qco> i really want to get more into jazz . could you send any recommendations my way</qco> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
the word jazz makes my head explode because it means like 12,000 different things over the past 100 years. it all comes down to what made you ask this. what you're really looking for is probably whatever it was at that exact moment that made you think you want this. For example, let's say the reason you are asking this is because last night you walked past a music venue that said "jazz" on it, and it made you feel good for whatever reason and that's what made you think that what you're looking for is probably called 'jazz'.  Or maybe you met a cool person who told you they like 'jazz'. Either way, your best option is to recall the scenario that inspired this desire, and go back there and you'll probably find a trail of bread crumbs from there to your next destination

5:41 pm</dco> &nbsp;<qco> thoughts on 6/4 time? someone told me no one makes songs in 6/4</qco> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
a lot of people do it without knowing it. they'll put 3/4 on the page and have tiny bars when it really might have been better to say 6/4. there's no reason 'we wish you a merry christmas', 'happy birthday', 'you make me feel like a natural woman', and trillions of other popular songs from every generation wouldn't really be better off saying 6/4 on the page. or, depending on the tempo, be converted to 6/8 or even written as 4/4 and put everything in triplets. a lot of different notation options for songs in 3-feels. But songs with a 4-feel tend to just use 4/4 because it's all groups of 4 within groups of 4 within groups of 4, so 4/4 will always fit. I'd say about 20% of songs use some kind of 3-feel, and within that you're going to have a million different ways of writing the same thing. so those time signatures (6/4, 6/8, etc) would appear less common, but they are used for the same type of music which again i'd say comprises at least 10% of music from all generations

<br/>i think i need some advice. i have a synthesizer that i would like to use to make my own music. the problem is that i don't have a daw besides audacity, which i have heard has limitations. almost everyone i look up to uses some variation of logic, but i feel like completely switching to a new os would be even more of a problem. speaking of that, i really don't even have a usable computer because mine is very bad and freezes up trying to load a browser let alone handle a daw or a video editor. anyway i guess i am here to see if you have any advice? i have all these ideas but no way to document them really, and it's getting to be a lot</qco> </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
this could be a blessing. maybe you can find 1 sound in the keyboard and then learn to just play it while singing at the same time. and then record that on 1 microphone, like the one on your phone. there's a lot you probably want to learn about yourself and how you make music, and usually it's best to just start with the simplest thing that's available. you don't even know what you want yet, and the advantage with using exactly what you have is it's probably a unique set of tools that aren't exactly what any other person has. you're gonna have a unique sound automatically. it reminds me of that guy that lived next to a spatula, so he made spatula music. there's not very much spatula music out there, so, someone's gotta do it

what i get during the writing process is like the version of it that 1 person could perform and sing at a keyboard. including some of the more prominent and memorable non-vocal parts, if applicable. including knowing the exact tempo and road map. that's how the writing goes. for production it's temp ints then vocs then delete the temp insts and do the rest of the insts in sort of a brew cocktail mode that combines the whole instrumental arrangement/recording process together, given that i already know how the song goes based on how the writing process went before. occasionally checking back to the writing for reference

it comes up a lot when trying to figure out things for 3D animation. the folding doors in the juggling video definitely required some trigonomic functions to work correctly, and believe me i tried to find an easier way first, but that was the only way. Actually it's still not even good enough really, because it looks like the doors are springloaded somehow because they are all unfolding at the same time. the real effect i wanted was for them to each unfold sort of 1 at a time as they begin to be dragged by the previous one. but that would have required some calculus which was over my head in the moment and i didn't think it would be wise to spend days working it out

'C9' is short for C dominant 9, which at minimum should include the notes E, Bb, and D, with C in the bass. If you want it to have B instead of Bb, you'd probably write Cmaj9, and if you wanted neither B nor Bb you'd probably write Cadd9 or Cadd2
