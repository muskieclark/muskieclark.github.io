  <h1>song ideas</h1>
  <h2>psychological something weird maybe this is illegal idk</h2>
  <p>i wanna make a song that has frequencies or combinations of frequencies that have short psychological effects on people<br>
  maybe it starts out normal at fist bbut then it slowly gets more distorted and psychologically affective?<br>
  or maybe it is normal but then randomly cuts out to weird psychological music in increasingly long intervals til the song ends? idk</p>
  <div class="column right">
    <h2>inspirations</h2>
    <p>Feb 24, 2023 - i really like halfalive's ok ok, i like what they did with the panning and the vocal percussion going from<br>
    ear to ear. maybe i could incorporate something like this into moon song since it's supposed to be a less percussive track<br>
    (instad of using drums i would take inspiration from this method).</p>
