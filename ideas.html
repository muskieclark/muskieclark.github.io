      <h1>song ideas</h1>
  <h2>song name idea</h2>
    <p>going to call the unnamed song "method-like". it sounds random, but just like any of my other songs,
  it has a backstory, whether that be the title or in the lyrics itself.</p>
  
      <h2>psychological something weird maybe this is illegal idk</h2>
      <p>i wanna make a song that has frequencies or combinations of frequencies that have short psychological effects on people<br>
      maybe it starts out normal at fist bbut then it slowly gets more distorted and psychologically affective?<br>
      or maybe it is normal but then randomly cuts out to weird psychological music in increasingly long intervals til the song ends? idk</p>
