  <h1>lyrics</h1>
  <h2>Method Like</h2>
  <p>Color’s such a nice thing<br>
Trees are budding, grass turns green<br>
Towers tower over me<br>
I find it fun how the moon follows me<br>
<br>
But don’t you see that I can’t breathe?<br>
I don’t need air, no that can’t be<br>
I need to know, and right now, please<br>
<br>
Wonder why uh-nothing seems alright<br>
My mind wavers, in and out of time<br>
<br>
Pass right by, the outside<br>
But to me the outside’s far<br>
And if I step out and disturb<br>
The peaceful sea, will I break everything?<br>
<br>
I don’t see the world as giving up,<br>
In fact, I don’t see much at all, no<br>
It’s a method I don’t like, and-<br>
<br>
I see the rain falling from the tops of, the trees<br>
Do you see this too? Or do we see all differently<br>
I see the temperature, high of 20 at best<br>
Is that really cold, or is it all in our heads, oh-
</p>
  <h2>lventuaIly</h2>
  <p>Words are empty sounds to me<br>
  While in the night I try to sleep<br>
  Pondering and wondering if I will ever sew the seam<br>
  Transitioning, not listening<br>
  I see the pass in front of<br>
  and right as I'm about to take it<br>
  Turn and face the<br>
  <br>
  I find the indecisiveness my biggest fate<br>
  Spending long amounts of time inside my brain<br>
  If I could get myself out of the stories that my mind creates<br>
  I think I'll find my way out of here someday<br>
  <br>
  My heart on fire inside of me<br>
  Spinning in circles, until I find the best in me<br>
  Eventually, we will see<br>
  Is it enough to set me free<br>
  My heart on fire inside of me<br>
  Spinning in circles, until i find the best in me<br>
  Eventually<br>
  We will see<br>
  Is it enough to set me free<br>
  <br>
  See myself inside my dream<br>
  Will I fulfil my phrophecy<br>
  I learn from what I know I see<br>
  I analyze the other people<br>
  Letting go for one last time<br>
  I gotta leave the past behind<br>
  If someone finds me here I gotta<br>
  (Run away)<br>
  And so I say for all to hear<br>
  No longer one thing I hold dear<br>
  I leave behind my memories for many coming centuries<br>
  Inside my head<br>
  Here comes the dread<br>
  But no regret as I have said<br>
  Right as I'm about to take it<br>
  Turn and face the<br>
  <br>
  My heart on fire inside of me<br>
  Spinning in circles, until I find the best in me<br>
  (My heart on fire inside of me<br>
  Spinning in circles, until I find the best in me)<br>
  Eventually, we will see<br>
  Is it enough to set me free?</p>
