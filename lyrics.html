  <h2>moon song (unreleased)</h2>
  <p>It came from nowhere<br>
  The bright white full moon,<br>
  It spoke in the language of dreams.<br>
  Sweet Moon Song;<br>
  What are you telling me?<br>
  <br>
  Why is it always reminding me of<br>
  A rainy wish that never could be?<br>
  Sweet Moon Song;<br>
  What are you telling me?<br>
  <br>
  It came gliding into my heart riding<br>
  on a moon beam from above.<br>
  Dancing endlessly, I watched it spindling<br>
  It played across the stars<br>
  <br>
  Then<br>
  I heard it singing of what could have been,<br>
  How I could have lived in my dreams;<br>
  Sweet Moon Song;<br>
  What are you telling me?<br>
  <br>
  Hmm...<br>
  It rode on a moon beam from above.<br>
  It was so beautiful, the night it passed by<br>
  It played across the stars<br>
  <br>
  Then<br>
  I heard it singing of what could have been,<br>
  How I could have lived in my dreams;<br>
  Sweet Moon Song;<br>
  What are you telling me?<br></p>
  <h2>lventuaIly</h2>
  <p>Words are empty sounds to me<br>
  While in the night I try to sleep<br>
  Pondering and wondering if I will ever sew the seam<br>
  Transitioning, not listening<br>
  I see the pass in front of<br>
  and right as I'm about to take it<br>
  Turn and face the<br>
  <br>
  I find the indecisiveness my biggest fate<br>
  Spending long amounts of time inside my brain<br>
  If I could get myself out of the stories that my mind creates<br>
  I think I'll find my way out of here someday<br>
  <br>
  My heart on fire inside of me<br>
  Spinning in circles, until I find the best in me<br>
  Eventually, we will see<br>
  Is it enough to set me free<br>
  My heart on fire inside of me<br>
  Spinning in circles, until i find the best in me<br>
  Eventually<br>
  We will see<br>
  Is it enough to set me free<br>
  <br>
  See myself inside my dream<br>
  Will I fulfil my phrophecy<br>
  I learn from what I know I see<br>
  I analyze the other people<br>
  Letting go for one last time<br>
  I gotta leave the past behind<br>
  If someone finds me here I gotta<br>
  (Run away)<br>
  And so I say for all to hear<br>
  No longer one thing I hold dear<br>
  I leave behind my memories for many coming centuries<br>
  Inside my head<br>
  Here comes the dread<br>
  But no regret as I have said<br>
  Right as I'm about to take it<br>
  Turn and face the<br>
  <br>
  My heart on fire inside of me<br>
  Spinning in circles, until I find the best in me<br>
  (My heart on fire inside of me<br>
  Spinning in circles, until I find the best in me)<br>
  Eventually, we will see<br>
  Is it enough to set me free?</p>
