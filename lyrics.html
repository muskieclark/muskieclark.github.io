   <h1>lyrics</h1>
    <h2>lventuaIly</h2>
    <p>Words are empty sounds to me<br>
While in the night I try to sleep<br>
Pondering and wondering if I will ever sew the seam<br>
Transitioning, not listening<br>
I see the pass in front of <br>
and right as I'm about to take it<br>
Turn and face the<br>
<br>
I find the indecisiveness my biggest fate<br>
Spending long amounts of time inside my brain<br>
If I could get myself out of the stories that my mind creates<br>
I think I'll find my way out of here someday<br>
<br>
My heart on fire inside of me<br>
Spinning in circles, until I find the best in me<br>
Eventually, we will see<br>
Is it enough to set me free<br>
My heart on fire inside of me<br>
Spinning in circles, until i find the best in me<br>
Eventually <br>
We will see<br>
Is it enough to set me free<br>
<br>
See myself inside my dream<br>
Will I fulfil my phrophecy<br>
I learn from what I know I see<br>
I analyze the other people<br>
Letting go for one last time<br>
I gotta leave the past behind<br>
If someone finds me here I gotta<br>
(Run away)<br>
And so I say for all to hear<br>
No longer one thing I hold dear<br>
I leave behind my memories for many coming centuries<br>
Inside my head<br>
Here comes the dread<br>
But no regret as I have said<br>
Right as I'm about to take it<br>
Turn and face the<br>
<br>
My heart on fire inside of me<br>
Spinning in circles, until I find the best in me<br>
(My heart on fire inside of me<br>
Spinning in circles, until I find the best in me) <br>
Eventually, we will see<br>
Is it enough to set me free</p>
